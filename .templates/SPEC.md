# Title: Technical Project Specification

Description: This template provides a structured approach for creating a technical specification document. It includes sections for project details, purpose, core functionality, architecture overview, design details, API design, environment variables, technology stack, and more.

### Purpose
- [Main goal of this feature, tool, or system.]

### Core Functionality
- [List of key features, expected behaviors, and common use cases]

### Architecture Overview
- [Summary of the technical setup, frameworks used, and main modules or services.]

### Architecture & Design Details
- [detailed information about the architecture, including design patterns, data flow, and component interactions.]
```
- [architecture diagram or description]
- Component interactions
- Data flow
- External dependencies
```
- Example:
  - Design Pattern: MVC (Model-View-Controller)
  - Data Flow: User input -> Controller -> Model -> View -> User output
  - Component Interactions: Controller interacts with Model and View, Model interacts with Database, View interacts with Controller

### API Design
```yaml
# OpenAPI/Swagger specification or key endpoints
# Authentication methods
# Rate limiting
# Error handling patterns
```

### Environment Variables and Provider Login Details
- Link to .env.tpl for a list all environment variables used by the project, their purpose, and default values.

### Technology Stack
- **Frontend**: [Framework/Library, Version]
- **Backend**: [Framework/Language, Version]
- **Database**: [Type, Version]
- **Infrastructure**: [Cloud provider, containerization, etc.]
- **External APIs/Services**: [List of integrations]
- **Development Tools**: [IDE, build tools, package managers]

### System Requirements
- **Performance**: [Response time, throughput, scalability requirements]
- **Security**: [Authentication, authorization, data protection requirements]
- **Compatibility**: [Browser support, OS or platform requirements, mobile responsiveness]

### Input and Output Contracts
- Set all inputs and outputs in a table-like format:
  - Input: describe the input data, its format, and where it comes from.
  - Output: describe the output data, its format, and its destination.
  - Example:
    - Input: User ID (string)
    - Output: User details (JSON object)

### Edge Cases and Constraints
- [List of known limitations, special scenarios, and fallback behaviors]

### File and Module Map
- [List of all important files or modules and descriptions what each one is responsible for.]

### Dependencies
- [List of all external dependencies and their versions]
- Example:
  - `requests`: HTTP client library (version: `2.25.1`)
  - `numpy`: Numerical computing library (version: `1.21.2`)

### Deployment Guide
- [Description of the steps required to deploy the project, including any prerequisites, configuration, and environment setup]
  - Prerequisites: [List of any required software or tools]
  - Configuration: [Description of how to configure the project for different environments]
  - Environment Setup: [instructions for setting up the development environment]

### Environment Variables (no secrets!)
- [Definition of local and remote directory, repository & filepaths]
  - Example:
  - [APP_NAME]_REMOTE_REPOSITORY_DIR=[REMOTE_DIR_PATH]
  - [APP_NAME]_LOCAL_REPOSITORY_DIR=[LOCAL_DIR_PATH]
  - CACHE_DIR=[PATH_TO_CACHE_DIR]
- Define Provider & Host Details
  - Example:
  - PROVIDER_NAME=[STRING]
  - PROVIDER_URL=[URL]
  - HOST_URL=[URL]
  - PORT=[NUMBER]
  - DATABASE_NAME=[DATABASE_NAME]
  - DATABASE_URL=[URL]
- Define Container details
  - Example:
  - CONTAINER_NAME=[DOCKER_CONTAINER_NAME]
  - CONTAINER_IMAGE=[DOCKER_CONTAINER_IMAGE]
  - CONTAINER_PORT=[DOCKER_CONTAINER_PORT]
- Define LLM Details
  - Example:
  - LLM_PROVIDER=[LLM_PROVIDER_NAME]
  - LLM_MODEL=[LLM_MODEL_NAME]
  - LLLM_INFERENCE_ENDPOINT=[URL]
  - LOG_LEVEL=[DEBUG,INFO,DEFAULT]
- Etc.

### Database Schema
- [Description of the database schema, including tables, relationships, and data types]
```sql
-- Key entities and relationships
-- Include migration strategy if applicable
```
Example:
  - `users`: Stores user information with fields like `id`, `email`, `name`, and `created_at`.
  - `posts`: Stores post information with fields like `id`, `title`, `content`, `author_id`, and `created_at`.
  - `comments`: Stores comment information with fields like `id`, `content`, `post_id`, `author_id`, and `created_at`.

### Open Questions or TODOs
- Link to @TASKS.md for unresolved decisions, logic that needs clarification, or tasks that are still pending.

Section: Last Updated
- Include the most recent update date and timestamp.

## env.tpl Starter Template (Markdown Format)

Title: Environment Secrets
- Secrets are ONLY written and read from @.env.tpl!
- Use 1password references for secrets and adhere to the 1password syntax pattern. Hint: The ENVIRONMENT_NAME is always the current repository name.
- Example:
  #API key for external service (default: `null`):
  [VARIABLE_NAME]=op://Environments/[VAULT]/[VARIABLE_VALUE]

### Last Updated
- Include the most recent update date and a brief description of the changes made. Link to the @CHANGELOG.md file for more details.
