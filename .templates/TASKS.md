# Title: Task Management - Development Phases

Description: This template provides a structured approach for creating a task management document outlining the development phases and tasks for a project.

### Development Phases

#### Phase 1: Foundation
- [ ] Project setup and configuration
- [ ] Core architecture implementation
- [ ] Basic CI/CD pipeline (nice-to-have)
- [ ] Initial database schema (optional)

#### Phase 2: Core Features
- [ ] Primary user flows
- [ ] Key business logic
- [ ] Authentication/authorization (optional)
- [ ] Basic UI/UX (optional)

#### Phase 3: Enhancement
- [ ] Advanced features
- [ ] Performance optimization (optional)
- [ ] Security hardening
- [ ] Comprehensive testing

#### Phase 4: Launch Preparation
- [ ] User acceptance testing
- [ ] Production deployment
- [ ] Monitoring setup
- [ ] Documentation finalization

### Task Structure
- Define a two-level task hierarchy:
    - Task 1
        - Subtask 1
        - Subtask 2
    - Task 2
        - Subtask 1
        - Subtask 2

#### Level 1 Tasks
- [List of high-level tasks with brief descriptions for overview]
Example:
  - Task 1 <timestamp> <priority> <description> <status>
  - Task 2 <timestamp> <priority> <description> <status>
  - Task 3 <timestamp> <priority> <description> <status>
- use green checkboxes to mark tasks as completed
- use red checkboxes to mark tasks as incomplete
- use red crosses to mark tasks as failed
- use alerts to mark tasks requiring attention

### Task Management
- use taskmaster-ai to plan, create and manage tasks.
- use taskmaster-ai to create @PRD.md.
- If taskmaster-ai is not available, use the following planning and management practices as a fallback:
- sort tasks by implementation priority and requirements, adhering to possible dependencies
- organize tasks into logical groups
- Start with the first task and work your way down the list.
- When adding tasks, ensure they are properly nested within the hierarchy.
- Ensure tasks are prioritized and ordered logically.
- Use clear and concise language for task descriptions.
- the user can add tasks to the list. Make sure to check for these manual updates and ensure they are properly formatted.
- Ensure that all tasks are properly formatted and follow the specified guidelines.
- Ensure that tasks with dependencies are worked upon in the right order, properly managed and documented.

### Full Task list
- list level-1 and level-2 tasks with detailed task descriptions, grouped into their logical clusters

#### Technical Tasks
- [ ] **Setup & Configuration**
  - [ ] Environment setup
  - [ ] Database setup/migrations
  - [ ] CI/CD pipeline configuration

- [ ] **Core Development**
  - [ ] [Specific feature implementation]
  - [ ] [API endpoint development]
  - [ ] [UI component creation] (optional)

- [ ] **Integration & Testing**
  - [ ] Unit tests (target: >80% coverage)
  - [ ] Integration tests
  - [ ] End-to-end tests
  - [ ] Performance testing (optional)

- [ ] **Documentation & Deployment**
  - [ ] Code documentation
  - [ ] API documentation
  - [ ] User documentation
  - [ ] Deployment scripts

#### Security Checklist
- [ ] Input validation and sanitization
- [ ] SQL injection prevention
- [ ] XSS protection
- [ ] Authentication security
- [ ] Data encryption (in transit and at rest)
- [ ] Access control verification
- [ ] Security headers implementation

### Documentation Requirements
