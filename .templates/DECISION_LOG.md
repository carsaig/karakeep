## Template Usage Notes for AI Assistants

### Parsing Guidelines
- Each section is clearly delineated with headers
- Checkboxes ([ ]) indicate actionable items
- Bracketed placeholders [like this] need to be filled in
- Tables provide structured data for analysis
- Code blocks contain technical specifications or example patterns

### Automation Opportunities
- Task progress can be automatically tracked via commit messages and pluggedin notifications
- CI/CD integration can update deployment status
- Testing metrics can auto-populate quality sections
- Documentation can be generated from code comments

### Integration Points
- Links to external tools (GitHub)
- Webhook endpoints for status updates
- API endpoints for programmatic updates
- Export formats (JSON, YAML, Markdown, CSV) for tool integration

## Last Updated
- Include the most recent update date and a brief description of the changes made. Link to the @CHANGELOG.md file for more details.
